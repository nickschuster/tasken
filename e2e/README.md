# Playwright E2E Tests

You will need playwright browsers installed.

Ensure you have the dev server running in another terminal before running any test commands.

`npm run test:e2e` for running the test suite. Optionally add `-- --ui` for debugging.

During debugging, before doing anything, run the setup test.

If you get into a bad state with the dev user (not able to authenticate or delete), delete it from your db and re run the setup.
